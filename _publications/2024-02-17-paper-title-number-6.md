Abstract— In 2025, Indonesia launches the flagship free lunch program, named as Makan Bergizi Gratis (MBG, or free nutritious meal). The initiative accordingly targets the improvement of human development quality, in achieving the vision of Golden Indonesia 2045. However, this program is receiving massive pros and cons among societies. This study aimed to examine public opinions regarding the implementation of MBG using sentiment analysis. We use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to capture the dominant topics and sentiment analysis using BERT to understand public opinions toward the MBG program. This study found five key topics: 1). Economic impact; 2). Budget and policy prioritization; 3). Food quality; 4). Program implementation, and 5). Community engagement. Sentiment analysis reveals negative sentiment around budget cuts and imbalanced food quality (topic 2 and 3). In contrast, economic impact, program implementation, and community engagement (topic 1, 4 and 5) are positively perceived. However, the tweet in economic impact topic is notably shaped by buzzer (an Indonesia term used to refer a social media user that works to “buzz” or to influence public opinion regarding certain issue) activities, particularly the hashtag #MBGDorongEkonomi, influencing public discourse. This result indicates that many positive tweets in are possibly from buzzers, manipulated the original sentiment. The shift from positive majority sentiment to negative majority sentiment indicates how much the Indonesian positive sentiment toward MBG program was artificially amplified. The sentiment distribution of filtered data is more reflective of actual public perception of the MBG program.
